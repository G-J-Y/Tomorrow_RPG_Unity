# Tomorrow

Tomorrow is a first person shooting game implemented using Unity and C#, the character (player) is left on an alien planet and need to seek her way back!

Purpose of the game is more on the side to demostrate the AI enemies' behaviours (decision making done by state machine & behaviour tree, path finding implemented by using point of visibaility, animation, group behaviour), and providing some degree of fun :).


The game is composed of three levels where the player will engage with most of the AIs in the first two level, and a boss fight at the end of the game.

The game is developed by a team of six members:

1. Luojia Yan
2. Xuan Li
3. Zijian Wang
4. Junyang Gu
5. Yaohua Zhang
6. Shiyu Lin
